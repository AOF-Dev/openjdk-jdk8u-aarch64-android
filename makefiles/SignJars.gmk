# (The terms "OpenJDK" and "JDK" below refer to OpenJDK and Oracle JDK 
# builds respectively.)
#
# JCE builds are very different between OpenJDK and JDK.  The OpenJDK JCE
# jar files do not require signing, but those for JDK do.  If an unsigned
# jar file is installed into JDK, things will break when the crypto
# routines are called.
#
# All jars are created in CreateJars.gmk. This Makefile does the signing
# of the jars for JDK.
#
# For JDK, the binaries use pre-built/pre-signed binary files stored in
# the closed workspace that are not shipped in the OpenJDK workspaces.
# We still build the JDK files to verify the files compile, and in
# preparation for possible signing.  Developers working on JCE in JDK
# must sign the JCE files before testing.  The JCE signing key is kept
# separate from the JDK workspace to prevent its disclosure.
#
# SPECIAL NOTE TO JCE/JDK developers:  The source files must eventually
# be built, signed, and then the resulting jar files MUST BE CHECKED
# INTO THE CLOSED PART OF THE WORKSPACE*.  This separate step *MUST NOT
# BE FORGOTTEN*, otherwise a bug fixed in the source code will not be
# reflected in the shipped binaries.  The "sign-jars" target in the top
# level Makefile should be used to generate the required files.
