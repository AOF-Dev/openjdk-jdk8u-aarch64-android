class HeapRegion;
class HeapRegionClosure;
class FreeRegionList;

// This class keeps track of the region metadata (i.e., HeapRegion
// instances). They are kept in the _regions array in address
// order. A region's index in the array corresponds to its index in
// the heap (i.e., 0 is the region at the bottom of the heap, 1 is
// the one after it, etc.). Two regions that are consecutive in the
// array should also be adjacent in the address space (i.e.,
// region(i).end() == region(i+1).bottom().
//
// We create a HeapRegion when we commit the region's address space
// for the first time. When we uncommit the address space of a
// region we retain the HeapRegion to be able to re-use it in the
// future (in case we recommit it).
//
// We keep track of three lengths:
//
// * _length (returned by length()) is the number of currently
//   committed regions.
// * _allocated_length (not exposed outside this class) is the
//   number of regions for which we have HeapRegions.
// * _max_length (returned by max_length()) is the maximum number of
//   regions the heap can have.
//
// and maintain that: _length <= _allocated_length <= _max_length
