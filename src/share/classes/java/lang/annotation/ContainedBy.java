/**
 * The annotation type {@code java.lang.annotation.ContainedBy} is
 * used to indicate that the annotation type whose declaration it
 * (meta-)annotates is <em>repeatable</em>. The value of
 * {@code @ContainedBy} indicates the <em>containing annotation
 * type</em> for the repeatable annotation type.
 *
 * <p>The pair of annotation types {@code @ContainedBy} and
 * {@link java.lang.annotation.ContainerFor @ContainerFor} are used to
 * indicate that annotation types are repeatable. Specifically:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The annotation type {@code @ContainedBy} is used on the
 * declaration of a repeatable annotation type (JLS 9.6) to indicate
 * its containing annotation type.
 *
 * <li>The annotation type {@code @ContainerFor} is used on the
 * declaration of a containing annotation type (JLS 9.6) to indicate
 * the repeatable annotation type for which it serves as the
 * containing annotation type.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * An inconsistent pair of {@code @ContainedBy} and
 * {@code @ContainerFor} annotations on a repeatable annotation type
 * and its containing annotation type (JLS 9.6) will lead to
 * compile-time errors and runtime exceptions when using reflection to
 * read annotations of a repeatable type.
